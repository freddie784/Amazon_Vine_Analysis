# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to get a quick overview of whether paid reviewers through Amazon's Vine program created more 5 star reviews than unpaid.

## Results 
- After using only products that had over 20 reviews and at least 50% of them being voted as helpful which were our factors to determin credible reviews. There were a total of 94 paid reviews and 40,471 unpaid.
- Of those totals 48 of the 94 paid revews were 5 stars and 15,663 of the 40,471 unpaid reviews were 5 stars.
- This created a 51.1% vs 39% of paid 5 star reviews vs. unpaid. 

This information is summarized by the table below.

## Summary 

On the surface after looking at the raw percantages of 5 star reviews show a bias for paid Vine reviews; however, there are significantly less reviews from paid reviewers compared to unpaid so further testing would need to be done. A test that could help with this is a t-test to see if the difference is statistically significant that would give us more accurate results then just looking at the differences.
